# Python Programming Assignments

![](machinelearning.jpg)

This repositry contains the python versions of the programming assignments for the [Machine Learning online class](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) taught by Professor Andrew Ng. I have completed the assignment through Jupyter Notebooks running Python3 Libraries. I've also took a snapshot of the [`notes`](https://github.com/kiritowu/Machine_Learning/blob/main/Coursera%20Machine%20Learning%20Python%20Assignments/Machine_Learning%20Notes.pdf) that I have taken throughout the course from my personal [Notion note-taker](https://www.notion.so/Machine-Learning-by-Andrew-Ng-691bfd31ddae49e180794870b9b5bb7e) (*JIC Notion is down one day*).
