# Personal Learning Journey

I do enjoy the entire process of Unsupervised Learning : Clustering as I found it thrilling to **Discover the Hidden Chest** in the dataset. Although I am aware that this example is in an extremely ideal state, it serves as a good example to demonstrate the clustering process. I also appreciate the multidisciplinary nature of data science that allows me to gain more exposure on devising inclusive and viable business strategy for the Mall Supermarket.
