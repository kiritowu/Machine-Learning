# Mushroom Edibility Classification
### Eat or Deceased

Author : Wong Zhao Wu, Bryan

## Modelling Objective
Build a **Simple** and **Interpretable** Model to Perform **Binary Classification** on Edibility of Mushroom from *Agarcius and Lepiota Family*.

## Keywords
- Supervised Learning
- Binary Classificaiton
- Feature Selection
- RFE
- Cremer's V
- Decision Tree

## Credits
- Mushroom Dataset: [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/mushroom](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/mushroom)

## Personal Learning Reflection
Through the mushroom classification problem, I've gained more hands-on exposure in terms of **Feature Selection** and **Feature Elimination** which is something new to me as in the past, I am more obsessed with chasing the scores at cost of model complexity. Since we can get perfect score with any modern classification models effortlessly with the mushroom dataset, **Model Interpretation** becomes the highlight since a black-box model might not be as useful than a **simple decision map** for an adventurer collecting mushroom in the woods!
