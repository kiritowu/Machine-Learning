# Personal Learning Reflection
In this project, I attempted the problem of COVID-19 forecasting using Time-Series models like SARIMAX. However, I realise that there are more to be done given the data available and I hope that I can take all the findings and publish it as an insightful dashboards to raise public awareness about the pandemic and urge the public to comply to COVID-19 restrictions to stay safe and healthy.
