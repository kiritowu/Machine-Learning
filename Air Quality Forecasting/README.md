# Modelling Objective
- To forecast the Air Quality of Carbon Monoxide CO, Nonmethane Hydrocarbon NMHC, Nitrous Oxide NOx and Ozone O3 for the next 63 Days(test size) using Univariate and Multivariate Statistical Model.

## Keywords

## Personal Learning Reflection
This is the first time that I embarked on solving a time-series related project and given the limited time I have, the best I can do is just to **Interpret the ACF and PACF Plots**, **Tune a Simple ARIMA, ARIMAX and SARIMAX model** and implement some cross-validation techniques like **Expanding Window selection**. I hope that I build a more robust model by utilising **LSTM Networks** (to maybe to predict some stock price next time).
